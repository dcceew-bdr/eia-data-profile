== Specification

_The Requirements listed here must be met by data wanting to conform to this Profile in addition to requirements from things that this Profile, profiles, in particular the <<LOCIDP, Loc-I Data Profile>>._

=== Data Structure

==== Basic Structure: Loc-I DP

This Profile's Requirements for the overall structure of data are based on those of the <<LOCIDP, Loc-I Data Profile>>'s, a diagram of which is shown above and that, in summary, are:

* `Feature` instances must exist within one or more `Feature Collection` instances
* `Feature Collection` instances must exist within one or more `Dataset` instances
* `Geometry` instances must be associated with at least one `Feature` instance

=== Model Element Mandates

The following table lists the requirements for the presence of classes and predicates assigned to data supplied according to this Profile. These requirements are in addition to those imposed by https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis#_component_models[ABIS' Component models], such as the <<TERNOntology, TERN Ontology>>.

A cardinality of `1` means mandatory. `0+` means zero or more, `1+` one more, etc. `0-1` means zero or one only.
