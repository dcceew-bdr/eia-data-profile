== Models

This Profile is a profile of ABIS and also contains multiple other models used to represent information that ABIS does not address. The list of all models and their purposes is as follows.

=== Model Roles

|===
| Model | Role

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis[ABIS] | to model scientific content - observations of biodiversity
| <<annex-a, Project>> | to link data to projects and programmes of work
| <<annex-b, Data Release>> | to record information about data withholding periods and other conditions for release
| <<annex-c, Submission Manifest>> | to describe packages of data submitted to the BDR for ingestion

=== Model Use Example

The following example data, which is not valida ccording to the BDR Profile of ABIS and is just for illustration purposes, includes elements from some of the models:

[source, turtle]
----
# An ABIS Dataset...
# containing a Biodiversity Occurrence Model Record
# and with attribution to a Project using the Project Model
# and with an embargo date from the Data Release Model
ex:dataset-01
    a tern:Dataset ;
    schema:hasPart ex:record-a ;
    prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:ProjectZ ;
    bdrpr:embargoedUntil "2025-06-30"^^xsd:date ;
.

# The Record is of a dwc:Occurrence as per standard ABIS modelling
ex:record-a
    schema:about ex:occurrence-x ;
.

# ABIS facts about the occurrence
ex:occurrence-x
    a dwc:Occurrence ;
    void:inDataset ex:dataset-01 ;
    geo:hasGeometry [
        a geo:Geometry ;
        geo:asWKT "POINT(143, -27)"^^geo:wktLiteral
    ] ;
.
----

The above information, if in a file called `data.ttl`, could be packaged and sent to the BDR in a submission described according to the Submission Manifest Model with this information:

[source, turtle]
----
[]
    a bdrsm:SubmissionManifest ;
    prof:hasResource [
        prof:hasArtifact "data.ttl" ;
        prof:hasRole https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-proj/rr:SufficientForValidation ;
    ] ;
.
----

The example Submission Manifest data above tells us that all the data in this submission is within the file `data.ttl` and that it is "Sufficient for Validation", meaning that it can be validated as-is, without requiring any further information to be added to it, which may be the case in some submissions.

=== Models Overview

==== Project Model

Model location: <<#annex-a, Annex A>>

The Project Model defines a `Project` is defined as "An Activity that requires concerted effort following a Plan in pursuit of an objective". The expected use of `Project` is to represent real-world endeavours - often called projects or programmes - that generate biodiversity information that is submitted to the BDR. This use allows BDR data to be attributed to particular initiatives.

The joining point between this model and the rest of this Profile and ABIS is that datasets of ABIS data - instances of the https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/tern-ontology?resource=https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Dataset[`tern:Dataset`] class - are produced by instances of the `Project` class as per the figure below.

==== Data Release Model

Model location: <<#annex-b, Annex B>>

This very small model provides predicates to introduce data release/withholding time periods and other information.

The joining point between this model and the res of this Profile and ABIS is that datasets of ABIS data - instances of the https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/tern-ontology?resource=https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Dataset[`tern:Dataset`] class - can have Data Release Model predicates declared for them indicating release/withholding information _for/from the BDR_. This model could also be used to describe such information for/from other systems.

The following figure illustrates the basic use of this model.

==== Submission Manifest Model

Model location: <<#annex-c, Annex C>>

This model defines a submission manifest - a description of data submitted to the BDR in one or more data files, packaged in a compressed archive file format (zip).

The BDR _Data Ingestion Pipeline_ - software that processes all submissions to the BDR - reads such manifests and processes the submission data according to properties within it and other metadata.

Submission Manifest information is used only to instruct the processing of data bound for the BDR (and potentially any other system wanting to also use this model) and no information in a Submission Manifest Model manifest file is stored within the BDR itself.

The example above in <<Model Use Example, Model Use Example>> shows a simple example of a manifest file indicating a single data file - `data.ttl`. The manifest file, likely called `submission.ttl`, and the data file are required to be compressed and stored in a single ZIP file archive for submitting to the BDR.
